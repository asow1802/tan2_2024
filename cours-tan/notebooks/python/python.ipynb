These libraries provide Python with extensive functionalities, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing, engineering, and data analysis.\n","NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. SciPy extends the capabilities of NumPy with further modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, and other advanced computations. Matplotlib offers plotting tools to visualize data and results in a graphical format.\n","While the syntax of Python and its libraries is distinct from Octave or MATLAB, it provides similar, and in some cases, more extensive functionalities, especially with the rich ecosystem of Python libraries available. This makes Python a favorable choice for many scientists and engineers worldwide.\n","## Accessing Documentation in Python\n\n","Just like in Octave where you can use `help` to access the documentation of functions and toolboxes, Python offers the `help()` function. This built-in function is one of the most valuable tools for understanding and getting information on Python modules, classes, functions, and objects.\n","To utilize this function:\n","\n","- Start an interactive Python session in your terminal or command prompt by typing `python` and pressing Enter.\n","- Once in the Python environment, simply call the `help()` function followed by the entity you want information about.\n","\n"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","help(np.array)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Python Conventions\n\n","Here are some examples of the conventions.\n","* ****Scripting****\\\nommands can be entered directly at the interactive Python prompt, or they can be saved in a script.
